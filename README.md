# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Welcome to the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project! This repository presents an end-to-end solution for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to effectively classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset Overview üîç
The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes a total of **284,807 transactions**, out of which only **492 are fraudulent** (representing **0.172% of all transactions**). Each transaction is characterized by:
- **Time**: Seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **V1, V2, ..., V28**: Principal components obtained using PCA.
- **Class**: Target variable, where 1 represents fraud and 0 represents non-fraud.

## Key Features of This Project üöÄ

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized the class imbalance in the dataset.
   - Analyzed correlations between features and the target variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled class imbalance using oversampling techniques like SMOTE.
   - Scaled the features for better performance with machine learning algorithms.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Trained and evaluated multiple models, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting
     - Support Vector Machine
   - Compared metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Prioritized metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset.
